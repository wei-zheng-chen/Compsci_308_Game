Game Title: Jack's Quest: DragonSlayer

The genre of my game will be a 2-D scrolling platformer (like Super Mario) and Turn-Based game (like Final Fantasy).The character will be walking through a scrolling platform and dogding monsters control by the arrow keys. However, when a player is unable to escape and bump into a monster, the game turned into a turn based game where both the player and the AI will be given an amount of hitpoint and attack styles.

As suggested by the title, the challenge of the game will be to slay a dragon at the end of the second or third level. As the level advances, the monsters get tougher and the player will also learn more attacks. At the end of each level, the player will be facing a sub-boss or main boss. Defeating the main boss will claim the player the winner and a point system will calculate based on #of monster kill and coins collected along the journey. The player will have three lives. Once the three lives are gone, the game will end and the player lose. The point system will still keep track of the coin collected and killcount. 

The machanics of the game will just require the arrow keys for movement across the scrolling platform. A "confirmation" key function will be added for boss fight or encounters while the arrow keys will still be use to select the different attacks. 

In each level increase, the monsters will get stronger and the amount of monster to dodge before the boss will increase. The hitpoint of monster will also be increase. The player's character will gain new ablities to fight the monster during encounters which brings them to a Turn-Based platform.
